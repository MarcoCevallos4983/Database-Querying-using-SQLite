# Database-Querying-using-SQLite
This project is the final assignment for the "Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python" course as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera. The main task involves executing SQL queries using Python to interact with databases sourced from Chicago's Data Portal. The objective is to showcase my skills in using SQL statements through Python.

In this course, we've learned about SQL, a language designed for managing and retrieving data in relational database management systems. For this project, I am expected to leverage Python as a tool to execute SQL queries. The datasets I'll be working with are derived from Chicago's Data Portal, covering various aspects of the city such as demographics, crime data, transportation, and more.

The primary goal of the project is to demonstrate proficiency in applying SQL statements using Python. This includes tasks like filtering data, performing aggregation operations, joining tables, and other common data manipulation and analysis tasks using SQL.

In summary, this project is a practical test where I get to apply the SQL skills I've acquired throughout the course to interact with real-world datasets from Chicago. The focus is on showcasing my ability to manipulate and query data effectively using SQL through Python.
